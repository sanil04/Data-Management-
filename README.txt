Title: Learning Python coding!

Date: April 9th 2023

Software name and version: Python version 3.1.1

Sanil's contact info: sanilsrivastava@cmail.carleton.ca

Description: This software's purpose is to process information from a .csv file and to display that information in various
forms, including an organized list or histogram. Specific information can be retrieved and processed based on user input.

Dependencies: You need to download numpy module as well as matplotlib.pyplot module to your computer. You'll also need many default modules and libraries that come automatically with Python 3.1.1, and finally you'll need to download Python along with any python interpretor(Wing 101 was used in our project)

Installation: To run our software you'll need to open a downloaded Python interpretor and open any files that are in the zip file. you'll also need to ensure that any dependacies previously mentioned are downloaded to your computer. From there you sould be good to run any one of our software provided you had the same documentation as us(ex: student-mat.csv).
